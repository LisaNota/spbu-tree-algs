# Graph Hidden Orders Finder

## Description
Graph Hidden Orders Finder is a Python application built with PyQt5 for visualizing and finding hidden orders in graphs. The application allows users to draw graphs, add vertices and edges, and then calculates all hidden orders based on the graph's edges.

## Features
- **Graph Visualization:** Draw graphs using the interactive interface.
- **Vertex and Edge Manipulation:** Add and remove vertices and edges easily.
- **Hidden Orders Calculation:** Calculate all hidden orders within the graph.
- **Export Results:** Export the calculated hidden orders to a text file.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/graph-hidden-orders-finder.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install PyQt5
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the application:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
2. Use the interface to draw graphs, add vertices, and create edges.
3. Click the "Find All Hidden Orders" button to calculate hidden orders.
4. Check the `hidden_orders.txt` file for the calculated hidden orders.
